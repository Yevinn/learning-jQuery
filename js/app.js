//Problem: It looks gross in smaller browser widths and small devices
//Solution: To hide the text links and swap them out with a more appropriate navigation

//Create a select and append to menu
//Cycle over menu links
  //Creat and ooption
  //option's value is the href
  //option's text is the text of the links
  //append option to select
//Create button to click to go to select's location
//Bind click to button
  // Go to select's location
//Modify CSS to hide links on small resoltuions and show button and select
  //Also hides select and button on large screens.
//Deal with selected options depending on current page
